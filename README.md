# ActiveMerchant::Adyen12

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/3scale/active_merchant-adyen12.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/3scale/active_merchant-adyen12)

This gem is to be used with [activemerchant](https://github.com/activemerchant/active_merchant)
It adds another gateway called Adyen12 to use with [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/) payment solution.
It uses the old V12 API

There is already an integration of Adyen in the official activemerchant gem
However it lacks recurring payment functionality.

## Why not making a Pull Request to the activemerchant repository?

**YES OF COURSE** a pull request there is the way to do it. But because of those reason we do not do it:

- this is just extracted from [https://github.com/3scale/active_merchant/tree/adyen](https://github.com/3scale/active_merchant/tree/adyen)
- we do not have time to make a proper pull request
- we cannot wait for the PR to be merged by them


**Still** we believe that this is the correct thing to do.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
